  <p id="myid">Fortnite is a popular free-to-play online multiplayer game developed by Epic Games. It’s available across multiple
platforms, including PC, consoles, and mobile devices. The game is best known for its Battle Royale mode, where 100
players fight to be the last one standing on a shrinking island. The core gameplay involves collecting weapons,
resources, and building structures for defense or attack.

Fortnite also has other modes:

Creative Mode: Players can create their own maps, games, and experiences within Fortnite.

Save the World: A PvE (Player vs. Environment) mode where players team up to fight against waves of enemies, complete
missions, and build forts.

One of the key aspects that keep Fortnite fresh is its frequent collaborations with other brands, movies, and pop
culture franchises, which bring unique skins, cosmetics, and in-game events.

The game is continuously evolving with new seasons that introduce new themes, challenges, and storylines. Players can
level up and unlock rewards through the Battle Pass, which adds to the overall progression system.</p>
