Fortnite also has other modes:

Creative Mode: Players can create their own maps, games, and experiences within Fortnite.

Save the World: A PvE (Player vs. Environment) mode where players team up to fight against waves of enemies, complete
missions, and build forts.

One of the key aspects that keep Fortnite fresh is its frequent collaborations with other brands, movies, and pop
culture franchises, which bring unique skins, cosmetics, and in-game events.

The game is continuously evolving with new seasons that introduce new themes, challenges, and storylines. Players can
level up and unlock rewards through the Battle Pass, which adds to the overall progression system.</p>
